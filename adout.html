<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey began when I chose to pursue my BCA degree at St. Xavier's College, a renowned institution that prides itself on providing a top-notch education in computer applications. Here, I have been exposed to a dynamic and immersive learning environment that has honed my technical abilities and nurtured my passion for innovation.

    Beyond academics, I actively engage in extracurricular activities and constantly seek avenues to enhance my skills. Participating in coding competitions, hackathons, and technology-related clubs has not only helped me refine my technical prowess but has also fostered invaluable teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving abilities.
    
    Looking forward, my vision is to be at the forefront of technological advancements and play a pivotal role in shaping the digital landscape. I am particularly interested in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, as they hold immense potential to revolutionize industries and improve lives. By staying curious, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning, I aim to contribute innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
